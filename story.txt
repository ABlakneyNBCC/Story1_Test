"ZERO HOUR" by Ray Bradbury

Oh, it was to be so jolly! What a game! Such excitement they hadn't known in years. The children catapulted this way and that across the green lawns, shouting at each other, holding hands, flying in circles, climbing trees, laughing.... Overhead, the rockets flew and beetle-cars whispered by on the streets, but the children played on. Such fun, such tremulous joy, such tumbling and hearty screaming.

Mink ran into the house, all dirt and sweat. For her seven years she was loud and strong and definite. Her mother, Mrs. Morris, hardly saw her as she yanked out drawers and rattled pans and tools into a large sack.

"Heavens, Mink, what's going on?"

"THE MOST EXCITING GAME EVER!" GASPED MINK, PINK-FACED.
"STOP AND GET YOUR BREATH," SAID THE MOTHER.
"NO, I'M ALL RIGHT," GASPED MINK. "OKAY I TAKE THESE THINGS, MOM?"
"BUT DON'T DENT THEM," SAID MRS. MORRIS.
"THANK YOU, THANK YOU!" CRIED MINK AND BOOM! SHE WAS GONE, LIKE A ROCKET.
MRS. MORRIS SURVEYED THE FLEEING TOT. "WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME?"
